      <h1>Kaspa Bricks: A milestone for the Kaspa community</h1>
      <p style="background-color: #70C7BA; color: #000; font-weight: bold; padding: 12px; border-radius: 6px; text-align: center;">
        ⚠️ THIS IS A PURELY SOLIDARITY-BASED PROJECT AND DOES NOT PROMISE ANY FINANCIAL RETURN. ⚠️
      </p>

      <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> Raise <strong>100,000 KAS</strong> to fund the first home and workspace powered entirely by <strong>Kaspa NFTs</strong> — for someone who can no longer leave home due to health limitations.</p>
      <p><strong>Kaspa Bricks</strong> is more than just a personal story — it’s proof of what’s possible when a strong, real community comes together with real-world utility. This project aims to become the <strong>first home fully funded through NFTs on Kaspa’s PoW-secured network</strong> — a milestone not just for one person, but for the entire ecosystem.</p>
      <p>The goal is simple: to help someone who can no longer work outside the home due to physical limitations <strong>build a small but stable life</strong> — a home and a workshop under one roof.</p>
      <p>Each <strong>digital brick</strong> minted is a symbol of what we can build together: <strong>transparent, decentralized, and human</strong>.</p>
      <p>On top of that, <strong>every brick NFT is uniquely numbered</strong>, making it <strong>collectible</strong>. Some bricks may hold special value due to their number or rarity, strengthening the emotional and community connection behind every contribution.</p>

    <section class="section" id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm from Argentina. I first got into crypto back in 2011 when I discovered Bitcoin. I tried some mining, but at the time it didn’t seem worth it — and life was moving fast. I had to work full time, and after the Mt. Gox hack, I stepped away from it all.</p>
      <p>For years I didn’t pay attention to crypto, until the COVID pandemic hit. Argentina had a really long and strict lockdown, and I had to close my small business for months. Around that time, my health — which had already been an issue — got worse.</p>
      <p>Stuck at home, unsure of what to do, I started reading about Ethereum mining. I spent what I had saved to build a small GPU rig and relied on credit to get through the following months. It wasn’t ideal, but at the time, it felt like my only chance to survive financially. Later I managed to get a few more GPUs and kept mining until Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake.</p>
      <p>That’s when I found Kaspa — around August 2022. I remember mining in SOLO and finding blocks that gave me 350 KAS. It felt exciting, like a second chance. I stuck with it. For the next couple of years, I mined Kaspa as much as I could. I sold small amounts to cover basic needs and kept some, believing in its future.</p>
      <p>My health kept declining during that time. I wasn’t able to go back to my old job, and by 2024 I had to move farther from the city to find cheaper rent. I still did a few tech repair jobs when possible, but they became more and more rare. Between that and the end of GPU mining for Kaspa, things got a lot harder.</p>
      <p>Now in 2025, I find myself without a steady income, unable to leave home, and with fewer ways to earn. I’m also trying to pay off the debts I accumulated over the past few years, but it’s been incredibly difficult — selling small amounts of the Kaspa I managed to save, month by month, just to get by.</p>
      <p>And that’s the part that hurts the most: I have no doubt in Kaspa’s long-term potential, and it frustrates me deeply to have to let go of what could one day represent a more stable future.</p>
      <p>Despite these hardships, I remain hopeful about Kaspa’s potential and the supportive community behind it.</p>
      <p>That’s what led me to create this NFT collection. It’s a way to try something meaningful — not just ask for donations, but offer something to the community in return. The goal is to raise enough to eventually buy a small home with a storefront, so I can live and work from one place. Something sustainable, something honest.</p>
      <p>I’ve made a commitment: I won’t touch the funds from this project unless Kaspa reaches $1. That’s my way of showing trust and long-term belief in the project and the people around it.</p>
      <p>If I ever manage to make this dream real, Kaspa will be accepted as a form of payment at the shop, and there’ll be a plaque in the space, dedicated to every person who helped make it possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="why-nfts">
      <h2>Why NFTs and why Kaspa?</h2>
      <p>This project doesn’t use NFTs for speculation or hype — it uses them to engage the Kaspa community in something real, instead of simply asking for donations. Every NFT minted represents a piece of a shared goal.</p>
      <p>Setting aside Kaspa’s undeniable technological strength, what truly inspired this project is the spirit of its community. This is about people helping people — and believing in what we can build together.</p>
      <p>The funds from this project are not meant for quick use or short-term needs. They will remain untouched until Kaspa reaches $1 — reinforcing the long-term spirit behind this initiative.”</p>
      <p>NFTs from this collection can also be freely traded or resold on secondary marketplaces that support KRC-721, continuing to promote Kaspa’s growing ecosystem.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="community">
      <h2>More than just NFTs — a real community</h2>
      <p>
        Last month, some Bitcoin maximalists questioned the authenticity of Kaspa’s community on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that our high activity might be driven by bots. While these claims arise from surprise at our engagement, the truth is simple:
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind every Kaspa account is a real person — passionate, dedicated, and committed to building something meaningful together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a testament to that authenticity. Every NFT minted represents a brick laid by genuine people who believe in Kaspa’s vision and community.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="nft-sold">
      <h2>If the NFT is sold</h2>
      <p>Every NFT sold will bring us closer to the goal. The funds will be carefully managed and transparently used only when the market reaches the threshold (Kaspa at $1).</p>
      <p>If the target is met, the project will start acquiring the house and workshop.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="nft-not-sold">
      <h2>If the NFT is NOT sold</h2>
      <p>We keep mining Kaspa. The NFTs remain collectible and tradable. We remain committed to building a community and spreading awareness.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="price">
      <h2>Price</h2>
      <p>The price of each Kaspa Brick NFT is 1 KAS.</p>
      <p>We want it to be accessible, so everyone in the community can contribute.</p>
